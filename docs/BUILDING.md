# Building ProsperoEden

ProsperoEden builds on Linux (Ubuntu 26.04; WSL works). One command builds the release:

```bash
make
```

The first run fetches every dependency at its pinned revision, builds the RADV driver and
Eden for the PS5, and writes the release files to `dist/`:

- `ProsperoEden-vX.Y.Z.zip`: the `PPSA99008` folder to copy to `/data/homebrew/PPSA99008`;
- `SHA256SUMS` and `release-notes.md`.

The first build takes a while (RADV and Eden are large). Later builds reuse everything that
already exists: the dependencies, this checkout's build cache in
`~/.cache/ps5-eden-headless.<hash>`, and ccache.

## Make targets

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make` / `make release` | Release files in `dist/` |
| `make package` | Only the app folder, `build/release/PPSA99008` |
| `make install PS5_HOST=<address>` | Copy `build/release/PPSA99008` to a console over FTP (close ProsperoEden first) |
| `make dev DEV_TITLE=<title ID>` | Development build, `build/dev/PPSA99008` (or `EDEN_DEV_PACKAGE_DIR`): profiling counters, `dev-settings.txt` switches, boots the given title |
| `make test` | Host (Linux) build of the emulator and its test suites |
| `make deps` | Fetch missing dependencies at their pinned revisions |
| `make deps-status` | List the dependencies, where they live and whether they match their pins |
| `make prepare` | Everything besides Eden itself: build cache, FFmpeg, packaging tool, driver stub, RADV |
| `make toolchain` | Check the host tools |
| `make clean` | Remove `build/` and `dist/` |
| `make distclean` | Also remove the fetched `.deps` and this checkout's build cache |

`JOBS=<n>` sets the number of parallel compile jobs (default: all cores).

## Dependencies

Every input is pinned in `tools/deps.json` and fetched by `make deps` (`tools/deps.py`) only when
it is missing: archives are checked against their SHA-256/SHA-512 before use and git
repositories are fetched at their pinned commit. Nothing that already exists is modified, so a
checkout you work in stays at whatever revision it has (`make deps-status` shows it).
Downloads are cached in `~/.cache/prosperoeden-deps` (`PROSPEROEDEN_DEPS_CACHE`).

Inside this repository, in `.deps/`:

- **Eden** at commit `5f142c7926d0c7fcbbd0ce30794d72f638a43b2a` (GitHub mirror archive), with
  Eden's own hash-pinned packages, which its configure step downloads. ProsperoEden does not
  modify Eden's files: the PS5 frontend in `headless/` replaces and derives sources at
  configure time (`headless/inject.cmake`).
- **FFmpeg** at the commit Eden pins, built with only the decoders games use.
- **PS5 OpenGL 4.6 SDK 0.6.0** (release archive), for the launcher and the OpenGL renderer.
- **OpenSSL and zlib** from pacbrew v0.40.2.
- **LLVM 18.1.8 compiler-rt** emulated-TLS sources and **fmt 12.1.0** headers.

Next to this repository (`../`), as git checkouts:

- **ps5-native-app-boilerplate**: the PS5 Payload SDK v0.42, the runtime `libc.prx` and the
  native packaging tool;
- **psradio** (`../ps5-radio-browser`): the prebuilt PS5 SDL2, RmlUi and FreeType libraries;
- **Mihawk's PS5_Vulkan, PS5_Mesa and PS5_PayloadSDK** (`../mihawk-*-review`): RADV and its
  build recipe. `make prepare` builds RADV once and isolates it beside the OpenGL Mesa
  (`tools/isolate-radv.py`).

The `libSceAgcDriver` import facade both drivers link against is built from
`tools/stubs/libSceAgcDriver.c`. Small contracts from our research repositories are in
`third_party/`.

## Host tools

`make toolchain` checks them: `clang-18`, `lld-18` and the LLVM 18 tools, `cmake`, `ninja`,
`ccache`, `make`, `nasm`, `meson`, `rsync`, `git`, `glslangValidator`, `spirv-val`, `bison`,
`flex`, `curl`, `wget`, `unzip`, and Python 3.11 or later with `venv`, `mako` and `yaml`.

The build scripts search the system directories and then `~/.local/bin`, so tools installed for
your user alone (for example LLVM 18 on a distribution that ships a newer one) are found too.
Host programs are compiled with `clang++-18` against the system C++ library; on a system whose
libstdc++ is newer than LLVM 18 understands (GCC 16), point clang 18 at an older one with a
`x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-clang++.cfg` beside the binary (`-nostdinc++` and `-isystem` lines for GCC 14's
headers). Configuration files are chosen by target, so PS5 compilation is unaffected.

## Release workflow

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs `tools/ci/build-release.sh` (`make release`) on a
self-hosted runner labelled `prosperoeden`. `EDEN_DEV_CHECKOUT` in the runner's `.env` may name a
development checkout whose dependencies are reused instead of fetched.

- **Manual run** (Actions > Release build > Run workflow): builds the release files and keeps
  them as a 7-day artifact.
- **Tag `vX.Y.Z`**: builds them, checks that the tag matches the package version, and publishes
  a pre-release. The release notes come from the README's "Changes in vX.Y.Z" section.

To cut a release:

1. Bump the version in `tools/package-headless-native.sh` and
   `headless/prosperoeden/ui/main.rml`.
2. Add the "Changes in" section to the README.
3. Test the build on a console.
4. Push a `vX.Y.Z` tag.
