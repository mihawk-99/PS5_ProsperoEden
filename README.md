  <strong>An unofficial Eden emulator port for PlayStation 5 homebrew</strong>
</p>

**ProsperoEden is an unofficial PlayStation 5 port of [Eden](https://github.com/eden-emulator/mirror)** - an accurate, high-performance emulator. All credit for the emulator core belongs to the Eden project and its contributors. ProsperoEden is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Eden team or Sony.

This is an early alpha. Video, audio, controller input, and saves have been confirmed working. Compatibility and performance will vary between games. The current release is **v1.000.030**.

## About this fork

This repository, [mihawk-99/PS5_ProsperoEden](https://github.com/mihawk-99/PS5_ProsperoEden), is my development fork of [blackbearreloaded/ProsperoEden](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ProsperoEden). ProsperoEden is updated often upstream; this fork is where I prepare changes before they go back as pull requests, mainly the integration with the PS5 Vulkan driver ([PS5 Mesa](https://github.com/mihawk-99/PS5_Mesa), [PS5 Vulkan](https://github.com/mihawk-99/PS5_Vulkan)) and the [payload SDK fork](https://github.com/mihawk-99/PS5_PayloadSDK). Releases come from the upstream repository. Everything below this section is upstream's README, kept unchanged so merges stay clean.

- **`main`** is upstream's `main` plus the work that has not been merged upstream yet. It is the development line: work lands there.
- **Upstream is merged in, never rebased onto.** `main` is published, so it is never rewritten or force-pushed.
- **Pull requests** go from a short-lived branch cut from `upstream/main`, so each one carries only its own change. The branch is deleted once upstream merges it, and the merge comes back to `main` with the next sync.

Changes on this fork's `main` that upstream does not have yet:

- **Resolution setting** in **Settings > Video**: 720p, 1080p, 4K or 8K, applied per console mode (handheld games reach each exactly; docked 720p is 810 lines, Eden's nearest step). The Vulkan game frame is now the display's 3840x2160 instead of a 1920x1080 frame stretched to it, and the FPS overlay shows the chosen resolution. Measured with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe docked: 4K holds 60 fps with the GPU about 19% busy; 8K mostly holds 60 with the GPU about 55% busy.
- **Faster first draws of new effects**: graphics pipelines are built unoptimised first and swapped for the optimised build when a background thread finishes it (dev-settings `fast_pipelines=off` restores upstream's behaviour). In Mario Kart 8 Deluxe from a cold cache, draws waited 32% less for pipelines.
- **Current PS5 Vulkan driver**: PS5 Mesa `0b2d6d1` and PS5 Vulkan `d609d71`.
- **RADV's shader cache works** and lives in `/data/prosperoeden/cache/radv` (elevation had left the effective group apart from the real one, which turns Mesa's disk cache off).
- **More memory for the GPU**: the 3 GiB heap is committed as it grows, the texture cache plans from what the 12 GiB pool can actually give, and a game that runs out of memory above 1080p restarts one resolution step lower (remembered per game until the resolution is chosen again). See [docs/MEMORY_FINDINGS.md](docs/MEMORY_FINDINGS.md), including an open question: the console powered off during a test of sparse page tables, which stay off by default.
- **Patches per game**: copy each game's patch folder directly into `/data/prosperoeden/patches` (for a cheat database in the Atmosphère layout, the folders inside its `titles` folder, such as `0100F2C0115B6000/cheats/<build ID>.txt`; also `.pchtxt` mods and extracted mod folders). In the Library, **Triangle** opens a game's **Patches** page. It groups the patches by game version (matched by build ID): your installed versions first, then builds you don't have. Only the version in use starts expanded, and other versions are greyed out. **X** on a version opens or closes its group; on a patch of the version in use, **X** turns it on or off. **Square** switches the game to the focused version, and **Left/Right** steps through versions. Frame-rate and resolution choices replace each other. Chosen patches apply when the game starts. ProsperoEden ships no patches: it reads the folder you provide.
- **Updates and DLC**: put update and DLC files (NSP or XCI) in an `updates` folder beside `roms`. They apply automatically, as does an update packed into a game's own file, and the Library shows each game's version and DLC count. **Square** chooses which version a game runs (the newest update by default, an older one, or the game without an update), and the Patches page matches that version's build.
- **Build and install**: tools installed in `~/.local/bin` are found, the installer accepts FTP servers that answer deletes with 226, and generated header overrides can no longer be shadowed by stale ccache objects.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ProsperoEden.git   # once, after cloning
git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main && git push origin main           # take upstream's updates
git switch -c pr/<topic> upstream/main                                          # start a pull request
git push -u origin pr/<topic>                                                   # after committing to it
gh pr create --repo blackbearreloaded/ProsperoEden --base main --head mihawk-99:pr/<topic>
```

## Source code

The complete ProsperoEden source is in this repository: the PS5 frontend and launcher in `headless/`, and the build and packaging tools in `tools/`. To build it yourself, run `make` on Linux (Ubuntu 26.04; WSL works). It fetches every dependency at its pinned revision and writes the release files to `dist/`; `make help` lists the other targets. See [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md).

## Project foundation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Built on the [PS5 Native App Boilerplate](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-native-app-boilerplate), the same native foundation used by ProsperoLight.**
> It provides the native PS5 application structure, runtime, packaging, and homebrew deployment foundation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Graphics are powered by [ps5-opengl](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-opengl).**
> This OpenGL implementation provides the native PS5 rendering layer used by the Eden graphics backend.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Vulkan is powered by Mihawk's [PS5 Mesa](https://github.com/mihawk-99/PS5_Mesa) and [PS5 Vulkan](https://github.com/mihawk-99/PS5_Vulkan).**
> Mihawk's Mesa/RADV driver for the PS5 runs ProsperoEden's Vulkan renderer. Many thanks to Mihawk for this work and for [all of the PS5 projects](https://github.com/mihawk-99) behind it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Thanks to [ps5-vulkan](https://github.com/mpereiraesaa/ps5-vulkan) by mpereiraesaa**, an experimental Vulkan graphics and compute API for native PS5 homebrew.

## Features

- **Vulkan renderer (recommended)** - the default backend, running on Mihawk's PS5 Mesa (RADV) driver.
- **OpenGL renderer** - still available through ps5-opengl. Switch between them in **Settings > Video**.
- **Resolution and upscaling** - render at 0.5x to 2x of the game's resolution and choose the filter that scales it to your TV (Bilinear, AMD FSR, Bicubic or Nearest) in **Settings > Video**.
- **Game files anywhere** - keys, firmware, and games can live in any folder the PS5 can read: internal storage, an M.2 or external drive, or a USB device.
- **Folder browser** - pick the game files folder in **Settings > Game files**. It shows how many keys, firmware files, and games each folder holds. Hold L1/R1 to page quickly.
- **Library** - game covers, **Continue Playing**, and **Recently Played**, which keep working after you move your files.
- **Launcher** - an animated interface drawn with OpenGL, with sound effects (their level is in **Settings > Audio**) and a loading screen while a game starts. The home screen shows which controllers are connected.
- **Per-game settings** - renderer, resolution, upscaling filter and Handheld / Docked mode for each game (Triangle in the Library).
- **Game updates and DLC** - put update and DLC files (NSP or XCI) in the `updates` folder next to `roms`. They apply when the game starts, and each game's details show the update version and DLC count.
- **Shader cache** - shaders compiled in earlier sessions are loaded when a game starts, so an effect stutters only the first time it appears.
- **In-game shortcuts** - a performance overlay (Select + R1), and Select + L1 to end the game and return to the library.
- **Settings in one place** - a single JSON file under `/data/prosperoeden`, with game volume, mute, and detailed logging options. Logs keep the previous session.
- **Controllers, audio, and saves** - up to four DualSense controllers (one per signed-in PS5 user) with rumble and motion controls, game audio, and save data work out of the box.

## Install

1. Download and extract the release ZIP.
2. Copy the included `PPSA99008` folder to `/data/homebrew/PPSA99008` on the PS5.
3. Put your own legally dumped keys, firmware, and games in a **game files folder** (layout below). It can be anywhere the PS5 can read: internal storage, an M.2 or external drive, or a USB device.
4. Launch **ProsperoEden**, open **Settings > Game files**, browse to that folder and select it. The default is `/data/prosperoeden`.
5. Close and reopen ProsperoEden, then open **Library**. Setup is checked when the app opens, so reopen it after changing the folder or adding keys or firmware.

### Game files folder

Only these subfolders matter; the folder itself can have any name and location.

```text
<game files folder>/                    # e.g. /data/prosperoeden, /mnt/ext1/eden, /mnt/usb0/eden
├── keys/
│   ├── prod.keys
│   └── title.keys                      # optional
├── firmware/
│   └── *.nca                           # extracted firmware NCAs
├── roms/
│   ├── Game.nsp
│   └── Game.xci
└── updates/                            # optional: update and DLC files
    └── Game update.nsp
```

The folder browser shows how many keys, firmware files, and games each folder holds, so you can check a folder before selecting it. Moving your files later only needs a new selection in Settings; saved settings, covers, and recently played games carry over.

### App data

ProsperoEden keeps its own data in `/data/prosperoeden`, separately from the game files folder:

```text
/data/prosperoeden/
├── config/prosperoeden.json            # settings, including the game files folder
├── covers/                             # cached game covers
├── logs/                               # current and previous session logs
└── user/                               # saves and emulator user data
```

The app itself stays in `/data/homebrew/PPSA99008` and can be updated by copying a new release over it.

ProsperoEden does not include keys, firmware, games, or other copyrighted console data. Dump these files from hardware and software you own. Do not download or redistribute them.

### Upgrading from an earlier alpha

Earlier versions read everything from `/data/homebrew/PPSA99008/assets/`. That folder keeps working until you choose a game files folder, and settings are migrated automatically on first launch. To move to the new layout, move `assets/keys`, `assets/firmware` and `assets/roms` into any folder, then select it in **Settings > Game files**. The release ZIP contains no user files, so copy its app files over your installation without deleting your own data.

## Changes in v1.000.030

- **New launcher.** Every screen is redrawn with OpenGL: smooth transitions between screens, text that stays sharp, panels that blur the artwork behind them, and sound effects for moving, selecting and going back. **Settings > Audio > Menu sounds** sets their level.
- **Controllers on the home screen.** Four controller icons show which controllers are connected, and change as one joins or leaves.
- **Loading screen.** An animated scene shows while a game starts, on both renderers.
- **The Library opens at once.** The game list is read in the background, and the home screen shows each game's own name instead of its file name.
- **New music** on the PS5 home screen.
- **Smoother first-time gameplay.** The emulated CPU cores now share the code they compile, so each part of a game is compiled once instead of once per core. In large open-world games this halves the compile work and removes most of the stutter when gameplay starts or a new area loads.
- **Faster compiling.** Compiling a game's code now takes about 40% less CPU time, which shortens the remaining stutter when gameplay starts or a new area loads.
- **Startup hang fixed.** A game could stop for good right after starting, because the emulator's memory allocator could leave high-priority threads waiting on each other forever. Development builds also report where a slow start is stuck.
- **Games close in about a second.** Select + L1 used to take 10-25 seconds to return to the library; logging no longer waits on the console's storage, and the emulator skips needless teardown work.
- **Up to four controllers.** Each signed-in PS5 user's controller becomes the next player (player 1 is whoever launched the game); controllers can join or leave during a game, and games that ask for controllers connect every one in use.
- The Select + L1 and Select + R1 shortcuts work from any controller.
- **Vibration and motion.** DualSense rumble for games that use it (turn it off in **Settings > Controls**), and the controller's gyro and accelerometer for motion controls.
- **Resolution and upscaling.** **Settings > Video** now sets the internal rendering resolution (0.5x to 2x) and the filter that scales it to the TV: Bilinear, AMD FSR, Bicubic or Nearest.
- **Per-game settings.** Press Triangle on a game in the Library to give it its own renderer, resolution and upscaling filter.
- **Language setting.** **Settings > Language** picks the language games use (18 languages), with the console region that goes with it. It applies when a game starts.
- **Game updates and DLC.** Put update and DLC files (NSP or XCI) in the `updates` folder next to `roms`; the newest update and all DLC apply when the game starts, and the game details show them.
- **Build it yourself.** `make` fetches every dependency at its pinned revision and builds the release. The OpenGL renderer now uses the published PS5 OpenGL 4.6 SDK 0.6.0.

## Changes in v1.000.020

- **Vulkan is now the recommended and default renderer.** OpenGL remains available in Settings.
- **Choose where your game files live.** The new **Settings > Game files** browser selects any folder, including external drives and USB devices. The old `assets/` folder keeps working until you choose one.
- **App data moved to `/data/prosperoeden`.** Config, logs, covers, and saves now live outside the app folder, so updating the app never touches them.
- **Settings are now stored in one JSON file.** Earlier text settings are migrated automatically on first launch.
- **Faster Library navigation**, and covers and recent games that survive folder moves.
- **New icons** for controller actions, pages, and the Handheld / Docked mode.

**Known issues:** Ending a game with Select + L1 can take several seconds. Some games can still hang on the loading screen, and some demanding games remain slow. This is a testing pre-release, not a compatibility guarantee.

## In-game shortcuts

“Select” means pressing the DualSense touchpad itself, as in ProsperoLight.

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| Select + R1 | Toggle the performance HUD |
| Select + L1 | End the running game and return to the library |

## Roadmap

- **FPKG support** - install ProsperoEden as a fake package, alongside the current homebrew folder install. Each release now includes a ShadowMountPlus package image (`.ffpfsc`); installing it still needs testing.
- **More performance** - CPU and GPU work to keep demanding games at their target frame rate, including the short stutter when a game starts, heavy cutscenes, and games that run slower in Docked mode than in Handheld.
- **More reliable game loading** - fix the remaining hangs on the loading screen.
- **Faster exit in every game** - a few games still take up to several minutes to close.
- **Touchpad button in every game** - in some games the touchpad (Select) does not respond and only the Create (Share) button works.
- **Controller selection screen** - some games wait forever on the screen that asks you to choose a controller.
- **Import saves from Ryujinx** - copy a game's save from a Ryujinx data folder into ProsperoEden. Eden's desktop app can already link Ryujinx saves, and the code that finds them is in the shared code ProsperoEden builds; ProsperoEden needs its own import step in the launcher.
- **Launcher in your language** - show the launcher's own text in the language the PS5 is set to.
- **More game compatibility** - validate more games on the PS5, and fix what keeps them from running well, such as games that crash at launch.

## Issues are disabled

GitHub issues are turned off for this repository on purpose. ProsperoEden is a general-purpose emulator port, and the project does not host discussion of console makers, specific commercial games, compatibility reports, or where to find game files. Issue threads tend to fill up with exactly that, so there are none.

Please do not use pull requests or other channels to post that kind of content either.
